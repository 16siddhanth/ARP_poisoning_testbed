======================================================================

Generated: 2025-12-02 16:01:09

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This experiment demonstrates the impact of ARP poisoning attacks on 
network communication and the effectiveness of defensive measures.

PHASE 1: BASELINE (Normal Operation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Messages Sent:      60
  Messages Delivered: 59
  Delivery Rate:      98.3%
  Average Latency:    14.71 ms
  Packet Loss:        1.7%
  Interception Rate:  0.0%
  
  Status: Normal network operation. High delivery rate, low latency.

PHASE 2: UNDER ATTACK (ARP Poisoning Active)

  Delivery Rate:      63.3%  (↓35.0%)
  Average Latency:    150.01 ms  (↑135.3ms)
  Packet Loss:        36.7%  (↑35.0%)
  Interception Rate:  63.3%
  
  Status: CRITICAL - Attacker successfully intercepting traffic!

PHASE 3: MITIGATED (Defenses Active)

  Delivery Rate:      93.3%  (↑30.0%)
  Average Latency:    17.44 ms
  Packet Loss:        6.7%
  Interception Rate:  0.0%
  
  Status: RECOVERED - Defenses successfully prevented attack!

ATTACK IMPACT SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Delivery Rate Drop:     35.0%
  Latency Increase:       135.3 ms (920% increase)
  Traffic Intercepted:    63.3%
  
DEFENSE EFFECTIVENESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Recovery Rate:          94.9% of baseline
  Interception Prevented: 63.3%
  Attack Blocked:         YES

CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The experiment demonstrates that:

1. ARP poisoning attacks are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE without defenses
   - 63% of traffic was intercepted
   - Delivery rate dropped by 35%
   
2. Static ARP entries provide STRONG PROTECTION
   - Delivery rate recovered to 93%
   - Interception rate dropped to 0%

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Use static ARP entries for critical hosts (gateways, servers)
2. Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on managed switches
3. Deploy ARP monitoring tools for attack detection
4. Consider encrypted protocols (TLS/SSH) for sensitive data
